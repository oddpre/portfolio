// Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. This is an ever-in-progress portfolio, where I intend to update the site every Monday (Ideally on Sundays) to showcase my work so far. Changes on the site can be such as design-updates, content update with different projects
As of 16/02/2025 I will include a changelog for every update.

16/02/2025:
Added a Marquee slider to highlight technologies I have worked on and other very minor changes to skills-section.

For next sunday (23/02/2025): A Windows Form Game (match tiles)



// Project
TBD: Meet the Journals (Planning still in progress)
- A journal app.
